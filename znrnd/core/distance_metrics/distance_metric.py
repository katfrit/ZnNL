Summary
-------
Module for the parent class of a ZnRND distance metric.
"""
import tensorflow as tf


class DistanceMetric:
    """
    Parent class for a ZnRND distance metric.
    """
    def __call__(self, point_1: tf.Tensor, point_2: tf.Tensor, **kwargs):
        """
        Call the distance metric.

        Distance between points in the point_1 tensor will be computed between those in
        the point_2 tensor element-wise. Therefore, we will have:

                point_1[i] - point_2[i] for all i.

        Parameters
        ----------
        point_1 : tf.Tensor (n_points, point_dimension)
            First set of points in the comparison.
        point_2 : tf.Tensor (n_points, point_dimension)
            Second set of points in the comparison.
        kwargs
                Miscellaneous keyword arguments for the specific metric.

        Returns
        -------
        d(point_1, point_2) : tf.tensor : shape=(n_points, 1)
                Array of distances for each point.
